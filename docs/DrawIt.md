The above is horizontal rule follows.

# h1 Lists

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

The 2nd paragraph is a definition list. *Italic*, **bold**, and `monospace`:

apples
  : Good for making applesauce.
oranges
  : Citrus!

Nested list:

 1. First, get these ingredients:

      * carrots
      * celery

 2. Dump everything in the pot and follow
    this algorithm:

        find wooden spoon
        uncover pot

    Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.

Notice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents.

## h2 Block

Block quotes:

> Block quotes are
> written like so.

The block text indented 4 spaces:

    # Let me re-iterate ...
    for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }

Fence code like Pandoc to syntax highlight it:

```python
import time
for i in range(10):
    print i
```

## h2 Link

Here's a link to [a website](http://foo.bar),
to a [local doc](local-doc.html), and to a [current doc](#h2 Block).
Here's a footnote [^1]. And images can be specified like so:

![example image](example-image.jpg "An exemplary image")

## h2 Table

Tables can look like this:

--------  -----------------------
keyword   text
--------  -----------------------
red       Sunsets, apples, and
          other red or reddish
          things.

green     Leaves, grass, frogs
          and other things it's
          not easy being.
--------  -----------------------
